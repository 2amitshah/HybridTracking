loaderAndComputer_computeTimeShift computes the time shift between the optical and electromagnetic points. The file path should contain
some files starting with 'OpticalTracking' and 'EMTracking', each containing several measurements of one position in order to have the
correct transformation between the two coordinate systems. Additionally, there should be two files of a continuous measurement, starting with
'cont_OpticalTracking_1' and 'cont_EMTracking_1'. After an interpolation step in order to have measurements at the same points in time these data is
used to find out how much the data of the optical tracking system has to be shifted in time in order to be as good as possible aligned with the
electromagnetic tracking points. The euclidean distance between respective point couples (couples with the same time stamp, adding a time shift delta 
to the timestamp of the optical tracking points) is minimized using the function timeshiftfunction2.m.

timeshiftfunction2 computes the mean euclidean distance of as many points as indicated in numPoints between dataEM and dataOT. It always compares
the two points whose time stamps differ in a value deltaT. This function can be used to determine the correct time shift deltaT between the two
point sets when the meanEuclideanDistance is minimized. In order to minimize the meanEuclideanDistance the EM points and the OT points should be
aligned as good as possible (using fixed points we can compute the needed transformation before calling this function). This can be done using 
loaderAndComputer_computeTransformationEMtoOTpositions.m

loaderAndComputer_computeTransformationEMtoOTpositions computes the transformation to fit the points of the EM tracking the most exact to the positions of the OT
tracking. This can be useful for determining the time shift when we want to minimize the euclidean distance between the point sets.

After using loaderAndComputer_computeTimeShift we know the time shift deltaT. We can use it when we load data of EM and OT tracking and add it
to the timestamps of the optical tracking. This can be done using loadEMOT_withTimeShiftCorrection.m. This leads to having the respective points 
of the EM tracking system and the OT tracking system having the same time stamp when they belong to the same position in space.
