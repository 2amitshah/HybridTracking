- 05.23_Measurements
-> dynamic recordings:
--> cont_EMTracking and cont_OpticalTracking [CPP, dyn] *Form: circle at the top, then downwards and a zigzag at the bottom
--> mod_cont_EMTracking and mod_cont_OpticalTracking [CPP, dyn] *Form: circle at the top, then downwards and a zigzag at the bottom (same as cont_EMTracking)
-> static recordings:
--> EMTracking and OpticalTracking (7 pos) [CPP]

- 05.29_Measurements
-> dynamic recordings:
--> cont_EMTracking_1 and cont_OpticalTracking_1 [CPP, dyn] *Form: weird! many em failures
--> cont_EMTracking_2 and cont_OpticalTracking_2 [CPP, dyn] *Form: weird! many em failures
--> cont_EMTracking_3 and cont_OpticalTracking_3 [CPP, dyn] *Form: weird! many em failures



- 07.11_Measurements
-> Purpose of there measurements is to record data in a zigzag throughout the whole volume with a pretty high spatial resolution. From those data we can derive a good distortion map.
-> dynamic recordings:
--> EMTracking_testrun and OpticalTracking_testrun [CPP, dyn] *Form: long start and end without movement, inbetween a little curve inside a XY-plane
